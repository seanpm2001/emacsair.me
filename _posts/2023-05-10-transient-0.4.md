# Transient 0.4 released

It has been a while since the last release, in large part because there was one
major issue, I was struggling with.  A few months ago I finally came up with a
satisfying solution, and since that has proven stable since then, it is now time
for a new release.

- Transient has to update state after every suffix command.  If that
  fails for some reason, then Emacs ends up in an badly broken state.
  It was rare, but in the worst case scenario, that meant that Emacs
  refused to call any more commands and had to be killed.

  Naturally `post-command-hook` is the first choice to run something
  after commands, but unfortunately that hook is not guaranteed to run
  only once, and worse it is not guaranteed to run *after* the command.
  Working around this limitation made an essential part of Transient
  much more complex and fragile.  As new edge-cases were discovered,
  new and increasingly desperate heuristics had to be added, until I
  finally decided that relying solely on hooks was just not feasible.

  Now `pre-command-hook` is used to advice `this-command`, to add an
  around advice, which ensures that the state update takes place, even
  when `post-command-hook` is run prematurely.  The advice wraps both
  the function body and the interactive spec with `unwind-protect`, so
  we can finally be sure that the state change is always performed,
  and that the advice is removed again.

  It has been an interesting journey, and I have documented it in long
  commit messages.  If you are interested in the details, see [7b8a7d71]
  (which still tries to avoid using any advice), [51c68c87], [52cac9c0],
  [bug#61179] and [bug#61176].

This release also contains many other important changes, including many bug
fixes, but here I will just list some user-visible changes.  For information
on other changes, see the [CHANGELOG].

- Popup navigation is no longer considered a second-class feature and
  is enabled by default.  Some transients allow arbitrary non-suffixes
  to be invoked, so some key bindings, which were previously used for
  popup navigation, had to be removed, to avoid conflicts.

  Use the arrow keys to navigate between commands, and `RET` to invoke the
  selected one.  `C-s` can be used so search in the transient buffer, which can
  be useful, e.g., if you know the name of the argument you want to toggle, but
  don't remember the key binding and also don't immediately spot it.

- Added new option `transient-hide-during-minibuffer-read`.

- Added new option `transient-align-variable-pitch`.

- Added new command `transient-reset`, which clears the set and saved
  value of the active transient.

- When using Emacs 28, `execute-extended-command` can be told to ignore
  transient infix commands.  Even when using that Emacs version, that
  command does not ignore any commands by default, but this behavior
  can be easily be enabled using:

  ```
  (setq read-extended-command-predicate
        'command-completion-default-include-p)
  ```

  Infix arguments are implemented as commands, so they by default show
  up as completion candidates of `execute-extended-command`, which is
  useless because they are only intended to be invoked from transient
  prefix commands.  Enable this feature to prevent that.

- Infix arguments can now be invoked following a prefix argument.  To
  use a negative prefix argument use `C--`.  `-` cannot be used anymore
  because it conflicts with the most common prefix key used for infix
  arguments.

Finally I should note, that I still haven't gotten around to making the manual
more useful as an introduction (or to writing a separate introduction).  I found
it impossible to motivate myself to work on that, largely due to the situation
mentioned in the next section.

However, [Psionic K][psionic-k] has stepped up and created the
[Transient Showcase][showcase], a very useful resource.

# I need your support

The donations I receive for my work on Magit, Transient and many other Emacs
packages and projects, are my only source of income.  For most of the last ten
years that has been the case.  Unfortunately after all that time, I still earn
less than half of the median income were I live, and it has started to take its
toll.

For a variety of reasons, I find it difficult to ask for more donations, but
just waiting for more users to decide to contribute, without actively being
encouraged to do so, does not work nearly well enough.  As the fundraiser in
2017 and a more [recent][a] [appeal][b] have shown, if I do make users aware
of the situation and ask for help, then many are happy to donate.

But unless one checks Emacs news every day, such a one-time appeal is easy to be
missed; so for the foreseeable future, I am going to add a note like this to all
announcements and blog posts.  I need to find myself [1,000 True Fans][c] soon.

Thanks for your support!<br>
Jonas
