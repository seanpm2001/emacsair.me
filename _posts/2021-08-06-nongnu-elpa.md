# Magit available from NonGNU Elpa

I am pleased to announce the release of Magit version 3.2.1.

This is the first release that is available from [NonGNU Elpa].  It is
identical to version 3.2.0 except for dependency metadata, which had
to be changed so that this package could be released on NonGNU Elpa.

# It's Magit!  A Git interface inside Emacs

Magit is a text-based Git user interface that puts an unmatched focus
on streamlining workflows. Commands are invoked using short mnemonic
key sequences that take the cursorâ€™s position in the highly actionable
interface into account to provide context-sensitive behavior.

With Magit you can do nearly everything that you can do when using Git
on the command-line, but at greater speed and while taking advantage
of advanced features that previously seemed too daunting to use on a
daily basis. Many users will find that by using Magit they can become
more effective Git user.
