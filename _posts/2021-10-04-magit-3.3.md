# Magit 3.3 released

I am excited to announce the release of Magit version 3.3, consisting
of 88 commits since the last feature release two months ago.  The
release notes can be found [here][relnotes].

# It's Magit!  A Git interface inside Emacs

Magit is a text-based Git user interface that puts an unmatched focus
on streamlining workflows. Commands are invoked using short mnemonic
key sequences that take the cursorâ€™s position in the highly actionable
interface into account to provide context-sensitive behavior.

With Magit you can do nearly everything that you can do when using Git
on the command-line, but at greater speed and while taking advantage
of advanced features that previously seemed too daunting to use on a
daily basis. Many users will find that by using Magit they can become
more effective Git user.

For more information about Magit, see [https://magit.vc][home]
and [these blog posts][campain-articles].

# What changed?

- It is now possible to invoke wrappers around Smerge's "keep"
  commands directly from from the status buffer. The key bindings are
  the same as Smerge uses in file-visiting buffers.  [#4458]

- This one's funny because I though we implemented it a long time ago.
  Turns out it was implemented by the Ivy and we still had to bring
  the functionality to other completion framework:

  When minibuffer completion allows for a branch or a commit to be
  selected and the former is preferred and thus offered as default,
  then, if possible, offer the commit at point as the first choice
  initially accessible with `next-history-element`.  [#4291]

- Added new transient prefix command `magit-bundle`, which provides
  support for `git bundle`. [#4392]

- The last remaining alphabetic keys (both lower- and uppercase) are
  now bound in `magit-mode-map`.  `H` to `magit-describe-section`, `j`
  to the new `magit-status-quick` (or `magit-status-jump` in status
  buffers), `J` to the new `magit-display-repository-buffer`, `Q` to
  `magit-git-command` and `Z` to `magit-worktree`, and once Forge is
  loaded, then `N` to `forge-dispatch`.  (`Z` used to be bound to
  `magit-stash`, which now is only available on `z`.) [#4259] et al.

- `I` is now bound to `magit-init` instead of `magit-gitignore`, which
  continues to be available on `i`.  Users of the `magit-imerge` package
  (which previously bound `i`) should consult its library header for a
  suggestion on how to resolve the resulting conflict.  [b54b537db]

- The new command `magit-status-quick` shows the status buffer but
  avoids refreshing it for performance reasons.  [#4259]

- The new commands `magit-display-repository-buffer`,
  `magit-switch-to-repository-buffer` and variants thereof can be used
  to switch to any existing Magit buffer belonging to the current
  repository.  [#4259]

- An old attempt to avoid needlessly updating section highlighting
  did not actually succeed.  [#3976]

Other changes as well as bug fixes are listed in the full [release
notes][relnotes].

# New donation options

I have enabled the [one-time] Github Sponsor option and added a few
somewhat funny donation tiers.  Other fee-free options suitable for
one-time payments include [iban] (in Europe) and [zelle] (in USA).
