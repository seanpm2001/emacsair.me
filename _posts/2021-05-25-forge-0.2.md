# Forge 0.2 released

I am excited to announce the release of Forge version 0.2, consisting
of 386 commits since the last feature release two and a half year
ago.

# What is Forge?

[Forge] lets you work with Git "forges", such as Github and Gitlab,
from the comfort of [Magit] and the rest of [Emacs].

# Finally, a release!

I couldn't release this before releasing Magit 3.0.0, which I did
[earlier today][1].  Going forward I plan to release more often.

# What changed?

Well, a lot; but I did not keep a changelog and don't feel like going
through a few hundred commits now.  Let's just say there are
improvements across the board and that we shouldn't delay the release
any further just because I don't feel like populating the changelog. ;)
