# Releasing Transient

I am excited to announce the initial release of [Transient].

Transient is the successor to [Magit-Popup], which was created as part
of Magit at the beginning of 2014, and which was released as a
separate package at the end of 2017.  Magit-Popup itself succeeded an
even older implementation, `magit-key-mode.el`, whose first version
goes back all the way to 2010.

The next release of Magit is going to use Transient instead of
Magit-Popup.  The Magit snapshot from Melpa already uses Transient.

# Introduction

Taking inspiration from prefix keys and prefix arguments, Transient
implements a similar abstraction involving a prefix command, infix
arguments and suffix commands.  We could call this abstraction a
"transient command", but because it always involves at least two
commands (a prefix and a suffix) we prefer to call it just a
"transient".

When the user calls a transient prefix command, then a transient
(temporary) keymap is activated, which binds the transient's infix
and suffix commands, and functions that control the transient state
are added to `pre-command-hook` and `post-command-hook`.  The available
suffix and infix commands and their state are shown in the echo area
until the transient state is exited by invoking a suffix command.

Calling an infix command causes its value to be changed, possibly by
reading a new value in the minibuffer.

Calling a suffix command usually causes the transient to be exited but
suffix commands can also be configured to not exit the transient
state.

A more detailed introduction is available [in the manual][intro].  The
manual is very extensive and I am not going to rehash everything here;
not even every new feature.

# Improvements Over Magit-Popup

The main technical differences are:

1. Transient uses transient keymaps and embraces the command-loop,
   Magit-Popup implemented an inferior mechanism that does not use
   transient keymaps and that instead of using the command-loop
   implements a naive alternative based on `read-char`.
   
2. Transient uses classes and generic functions to implement different
   types of infix and suffix commands.  That makes it much easier to
   add new types.  With Magit-Popup that was so difficult that only
   one additional type was ever added, which was not part of the
   initial release.
   
3. Transient removes many arbitrary restrictions that Magit-Popup
   suffered from.  Most importantly any key can be bound to any infix
   and suffix commands and infixes and suffixes can now placed freely
   into groups, making it possible to arrange them thematically
   instead of based on type as before.
   
Transient also adds many new features, some of which are described
below.  I strongly recommend that you read the [Usage] part of the
manual to learn more.

Additionally you might want to see the section on [Related
Abstractions and Packages][related].

## Improved History and Completion

Every time the user invokes a suffix command the transient's current
value is saved to its history.  This values can be cycled through the
same way one can cycle through the history of commands that read
user-input in the minibuffer using `M-p` and `M-n`.

When reading the value of a command-line option, users are offered
reasonable completion candidates much more often than before.
Handling of minibuffer history was also improved.  If, and only if,
two arguments take the same kind of value, then they now share
history.

Both transient-wide and per-infix history are preserved between Emacs
sessions now.

## Interactively Enabling and Disabling Suffixes

In the past we got many requests to add this or that argument to some
Magit popup.  Magit's user base is very diverse; some users have been
using it and Git for a decade, while others are just getting started
now.  That means that we had to find a balance between adding every
argument that at least one user wants to be added and not overwhelming
beginners with a wall of arguments they never use.

To cope with that, Transient supports placing suffix commands on
different "levels".  Users can select a level to control how many
suffixes they want to see.  They can also place individual suffixes on
a different level.  This is done interactively, directly from the
transient.  See [Enabling and Disabling Suffixes][levels] for more
information.

Note that Magit currently places nearly all suffixes on the default
level.  So for the time being changing the level does not have as much
of an effect as one might hope.  But that will be worked on.

## Learning Git

Some users learn Git by using Magit.  That involves learning about the
available arguments.  For arguments we now try to always use key
sequences that are equal to the respective short argument.
Unfortunately that is not always possible, because Git does not
provide a short argument for every `--long` argument.

Transient can now optionally highlight such mismatched key bindings so
that you don't learn any arguments that don't actually exist.

# Breaking changes

- The values of arguments are now stored differently.  That means that
  all saved values are lost.

- Some key bindings have changed.  This includes changes to individual
  Magit transients (previously known as Magit popups), but also some
  of the commands that are common to all transients.  For information
  about the latter changes see [Notes on Common Key Bindings][notes].

  While using Magit-Popup, the key bindings for all switches had the
  form `-<char>`, while the key bindings for all options had the form
  `=<char>`.  That was a hard-coded convention and now that this
  restriction has been lifted we always prefer a key binding that
  match the corresponding short argument.

- Since Magit no longer depends on Magit-Popup, packages that depended
  on both packages but only specified the former as a dependency, now
  have to specify the latter dependency explicitly.  In the long-run
  these packages should replace their own popups with transients but
  there is no hurry.

- Users and packages who have added additional commands to existing
  popups have to adjust these bindings to add them to the respective
  transients instead.

- The Magit commands previously known as popups (and now as transient
  prefix commands) have been renamed from `magit-WORD-popup` to
  `magit-WORD`.
