# Llama â€“ Anonymous function literals for Emacs-Lisp

I am excited to announce the first release of [Llama], a package that
implements anonymous function literals for Emacs-Lisp without relying
on a C patch to Emacs or adding an additional pair of parentheses.

Unfortunately anonymous function literals won't be added to Emacs
anytime soon.  The arguments as to why we would like to have that
has been layed out convincingly but the proposal has been rejected
anyway.

Several packages exist that implement anonymous function literals,
but until now they all either are waiting for a patch to the C part
be merged into Emacs, or they depart too far from the ideal syntax.

In a stroke of luck I discovered a loophole that allows us to have
almost the syntax that we want without having to convince anyone.

<pre>
    $(foo %)        is what I would have used if it were up to me.
    #(foo %)        works just as well for me.
    ##(foo %)       is similar enough to that.
    (##foo %)       is the loophole that I discovered.
</pre>

Even though there is no space between the second `#` and `foo`, this
last form is read as a list with three arguments `(## foo %)` and it
is also indented the way we want!

<pre>
    (##foo %
           bar)
</pre>

This is good enough for me, but with a bit of font-lock trickery,
we can even get it to be display like this:

<pre>
    ##(foo %
           bar)
</pre>

This is completely optional and you have to opt-in by enabling
`llama-mode` (or the global variant `global-llama-mode`).

An unfortunate edge-case exists that you have to be aware off; if
no argument is placed on the same line as the function, then Emacs
does not indent as we would want it too:

<pre>
    (##foo                                         ##(foo
     bar)        which llama-mode displays as       bar)
</pre>

I recommend that in this case you simply write this instead:

<pre>
    (## foo                                        ##( foo
        bar)     which llama-mode displays as          bar)
</pre>

It is my hope that this package helps to eventually get similar
syntax into Emacs itself, by demonstrating that this is useful and
that people want to use it.

Prior work
----------

- `#(foo %)` [https://github.com/abo-abo/short-lambda](https://github.com/abo-abo/short-lambda)
  with a patch to the C part of Emacs
- `($ (foo %))`   [https://github.com/cadadr/elisp/blob/devel/dollar.el](https://github.com/cadadr/elisp/blob/devel/dollar.el)
- `(fn (foo <>))` [https://github.com/troyp/fn.el](https://github.com/troyp/fn.el)

Past discussions
----------------

In 2015 Oleh Krehel (@abo-abo) proposed his [Clojure-like syntactic
sugar for an anonymous function literal][2015] on `emacs-devel`.  In
2020 his implementation and a few others were discussed on the mailing
list again, as part of a (much) bigger discussion about `dash.el` and
`s.el`.  The topic also occasionally comes up on r/emacs.

I think Oleh and others made a good case arguing for the introduction
of this new syntax but it wasn't enough to overcome the resistance and
I am not sure I can add much, except for an implementation that does
not require upfront approval.  Admittedly I have a hard time even just
explaining why we want this new syntax; I find it so obviously
desirable.  I recommend you read the original discussion instead.

Trying harder
-------------

Many people seem to dislike having to use the traditional `lambda`
syntax *in certain cases*, as is brought to light by the popularity
of `dash`'s anaphoric variants of most of its functions that take a
function as argument.

Oleh disliked the anaphoric variants and that is a major reason why
he implemented the new syntax; he wanted to give authors a better,
*universal* alternative.  (I want that too, but also I really like
the new syntax.)

Authors cannot be forced to use the `lambda` syntax, many authors do
whatever is necessary to get the short-hand syntax, regardless of
whether it has the blessing of the Emacs maintainers.

One argument that was presented against the new syntax was "think of
the children", the idea being that new non-programmer users will get
very confused by the new syntax.  While this is likely to happen, we
also have backquote syntax and locating the documentation about that
is equally challenging.

The success of `dash` made it possible to have things like `if-let*`
and `thread-first` in Emacs, but it failed to bring about anonymous
function literals.

As mentioned before, it is my hope that `llama` helps to eventually
get similar syntax into Emacs itself, by demonstrating that this is
useful and that people want to use it.
