# Forge 0.3 released

I am excited to announce the release of Forge version 0.3, consisting
of 48 commits since the last release four months ago.

# What is Forge?

[Forge] lets you work with Git "forges", such as Github and Gitlab,
from the comfort of [Magit] and the rest of [Emacs].

# What changed?

- Many actions that were surprisingly slow are much faster now,
  because an embarrassing bottleneck was removed in Closql v1.2.0.

- Added new option `forge-database-connector` allowing the use of other
  database connector libraries beside `emacsql-sqlite` (currently only
  `emacsql-libsqlite3` (experimental) and `emacsql-sqlite3` (discouraged)).
  bae6a527, 21720580

- Commands that take a topic or repository as argument now expect an
  object/row ID instead of an object or a number.  Objects are not
  suitable as interactive arguments because their printed
  representation would be presented to the user when using
  `repeat-complex-command`, and because they might not reflect the
  current state when used like that.  Numbers would be more readable
  and actually meaningful to humans, but additionally they would be
  ambiguous.  Non-interactive functions continue to expect objects
  as arguments.  #368

- Some essential key bindings that were somewhat randomly selected
  during initial development have now been changed for consistency,
  which I always intended to do, but did not get around to do until
  now.  `forge-dispatch` is now bound to `N` instead of `'` and Forge's
  bindings in `magit-fetch` and `magit-pull` now use `N` and `n` instead of
  `Y` and `y`.  `N` was chosen because it was one of the last alphabetic
  keys available at the top-level in Magit.  8c9614e3 et al.

Other improvements and bugfixes are mentioned in the [changelog].
