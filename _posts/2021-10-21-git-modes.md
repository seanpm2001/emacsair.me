# Git-Modes available from NonGNU Elpa and Melpa

I am pleased to announce that I have released [Git-Modes] on [NonGNU
Elpa] as well as on [Melpa].  Git-Modes provides three simple major
modes for editing Git configuration files.

Previously these modes were available from Melpa as three separate
packages named `gitattributes-mode`, `gitconfig-mode` and
`gitignore-mode`.  These packages have been removed and you should
remove them locally too and then install `git-modes`, but make sure
that it is already available before you do.  That can take a few
hours.

The motivation for merging the packages into just one is that while
many users may only regularly edit `.git/config` and maybe
`.gitignore`, it is not such a bad thing if a major mode is ready to
go when they first open `.gitattributes`.

To celebrate the occation, I have bumped the minor version to *four*,
hurray, though there aren't really any other noteworth changes.  What
else is there to say?

Well, this seem like a good time to thank all of the original authors
of these modes for their work.  So thanks you!

While working adding this package to NonGNU Elpa, I have synchronized
the [Non]GNU Elpa and `elpa-admin` documentation, which have diverged
a bit over time, and intend to help with removing duplication and
updating stale information.  The documentation is actually quite good
if you read it carefully.  If you plan to add a package to [Non]GNU
Elpa, then I recommend you look at the [README] of the `elpa-admin`
package; that is the most up-to-date and complete incarnation. I've
also found and fixed a few minor issues in `elpa-admin` and am going
to submit that tomorrow or so.

That's it for the night.  Happy hacking.
