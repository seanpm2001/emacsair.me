# At long last

It certainly has been too long since the previous release—once again—and
I appologize for that.  Going forward I plan to release every one to two
months.  I'm hoping that I can manage to average eight releases per year.

The problem this time around was that at some point it became impossible
to just do another Magit release by itself.  Several other packages
would have had to be released at the same time, because their previous
releases were no longer compatible with the development version of
Magit.

Forge in particular was undergoing heavy refactoring and was in no state
for a release.  A little while ago that finally changed, so last night I
could finally tag new releases for emacsql, closql, magit, ghub, forge,
orgit, orgit-forge, epkg, epkg-marginalia, borg and emir.  Announcements
for some of these releases will follow next week.

----

Magit development has gone through a somewhat boring phase (which isn't
entirly over yet).  The focus was on working through the shallow parts
of the backlog, so that going forward, I would be able focus on more
rewarding talks.

Or to give it a more upbeat spin, I've been working on doing
[sentiments](https://magit.vc/quotes/) like these justice:

<blockquote>
Love when I'm using a tool and get "damn this is well thought out"
feeling. Magit (Git client) for Emacs. Been using it for a couple of
years and still get these awe moments. — Hastouki
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Every time I use magit: How do I ...? It would be really cool if it
worked like this... Oh! It does! — Steven R. Baker
</blockquote>

As you can see, users have pretty high expectations of Magit, and
despite what this other quote might imply, this isn't the result of
magic but hard work.

<blockquote>
magit is a superb example of nominative determinism — eointierney
</blockquote>

So it is no surprise, that when a user runs into some less often used
command that does *not* do exactly what they had hoped for, they often
open a feature request to have it improved.  That is of course perfectly
reasonable and helps me determine what parts of the user experience
needs improvements, but since Magit is also very popular, it also means
that there is a steady stream of new work to be done.  On top of the
backlog, that is.

So that is what I have worked on these past few years: many instances
of "command X now provides better defaults" and similar.  That doesn't
make for exciting reading of course, so I won't provide that list here,
but if you are interested, you can find a lot of that in the [release
notes][rel-notes].

There is some new functionality of course, such as the three dozen new
commands (and that is if we count very conservatively).  Magit now also
provides context sensitive right-click menus.

----

For Magit to become what it is today, both is needed, innovative new
functionality, but also a lot of attention to detail and grinding.  When
it comes to Magit itself, the focus has been on the latter these past
years.

The more interesting development happened in the dependency Transient,
and especially the extension Forge.  More on the latter next week.

Likewise, while Magit development has slowed a bit, Forge and Transient
saw quite an increase in activity.

Another takeaway from these graphs is that development is in large parts
a one man show.  That is fine, and I am of course thankful for the help
I have gotten from Kyle and others over the years.

But given Magit's popularity, it also means that I have to personally
provide a lot of support.  The time I spend on that does not go into
development, so one way you could help me out, is by monitoring Magit's
["Q/A Discussions"](https://github.com/magit/magit/discussions/categories/q-a)
and helping other users.

----

So what are my plans going forward?  After all, releasing more often
cannot be the main goal.

Another thing I have to focus on is "marketing".  **You might not have
known this, but the money users pay me for my work on Magit and many
other Emacs projects, is actually my only income.**

Working on Magit, along with my other Emacs projects, is a full-time
job, my only job.  Unfortunately I am being payed much less than that.
At present I earn less than half of the median income (across all
professions) where I live.  This is a source of anxiety.

The only time my income ever increases somewhat is after releases.  In
between those the number of supporters slowly but steadily decreases.
So believe me when I say, that I would have released earlier, if only I
could have.

I know that as far as release announcements go, this isn't a great post.
It's also not great marketing.  But this is what we get when I try to
convince users to support my work; an honest message about my situation
and a plea for your support.

On a good day I enjoy helping users, debugging obscure bugs and even
writing documentation.  On a bad day I wonder why I am doing all those
things that are expected of a professional developer, for a starving
artist's pay.  If that is where I am at, why not just become an artist?
Why not just write software that does exactly what I need, and leave out
all the documentation and knobs that allows others to make full use of
it?

----

Well, that turned dark fast.  That wasn't my intention—this is actually
a joyous day!  So let's move on from that, but stay on the topic of art.
This sentence certainly brightened my day when I first read it:

<blockquote>
If Magit creator is the Bach of git, then Magit itself is
probably Chaconne, but I prefer the fuge from BWV 1001 (second movement)
so I'm tempted to call it that. — guygastineau
</blockquote>

That's very flattering of course, but I cannot live on praise alone.
They say that you only need "1000 true fans" to make a decent living as
an artist.  That seems about right.  **So here's my goal: make a decent
living as a FOSS developer of a niche but beloved tool, by finding 1000
users willing to support my work.**  Reaching this goal would make
everything else a bit easier.

You can track progress [here](https://github.com/sponsors/tarsius/).
If the ratio stays the same, this accounts for about 2/3 of my supporters.

Thanks for your support!<br/>
Jonas
