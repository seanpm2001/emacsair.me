# Magit 3.1 released

I am excited to announce the release of Magit version 3.1, consisting
of 31 commits since the last feature release one month ago.  The
release notes can be found [here][relnotes].

# It's Magit!  A Git interface inside Emacs

Magit is a text-based Git user interface that puts an unmatched focus
on streamlining workflows. Commands are invoked using short mnemonic
key sequences that take the cursorâ€™s position in the highly actionable
interface into account to provide context-sensitive behavior.

With Magit you can do nearly everything that you can do when using Git
on the command-line, but at greater speed and while taking advantage
of advanced features that previously seemed too daunting to use on a
daily basis. Many users will find that by using Magit they can become
more effective Git user.

For more information about Magit, see [https://magit.vc][home]
and [these blog posts][campain-articles].

# Another release already?

The big news this time around is that I managed to stay on the new
release-*about*-once-every-month schedule.

# What changed?

Bug fixes, mostly.  And tweaks.
Please check out the [release notes][relnotes].
